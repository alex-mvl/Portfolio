			<p class="caseText"><span>As a dog mom of 5 and lover of pets</span>, I have often browsed through pet adoption apps trying to find a furry soulmate. Oftentimes, this leads to shelters not replying back, inaccurate information, and a hard time finding an animal that will suit my needs as much as I can suit theirs. </p>
			<p class="caseHeading">What Is Out There?</p>
			<p class="caseText">Currently, the most well-known pet adoption app with over 30,000 reviews is Petfinder. This was also the only app that each of my interviewees knew of. I found that the app can be overwhelming to navigate and I know there can be something that can match two best friends together to form the perfect pair.</p>
			<p class="caseHeading">User Research</p>
			<p class="caseText">I began my process by researching competitors (Petfinder), conducting user interviews, and creating a user profile. I interviewed 3 people who have pets/used adoption apps. </p>
			<p class="caseText">I asked each of them a series of questions to understand what they view as important and their experience with any adoption apps.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Did you use any apps/other resources to find your pet?</li>
				<li>What do you prioritize in looking for pets online?</li>
				<li>If you used an app, what did you like about it?</li>
				<li>Dislike?</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="caseText">From these results, I was able to gather some key takeaways from each interview. Here are the key takeaways from each interview:</p>
	

			<div class="interview">
				<p class="caseText interviewHeading">Interview One (bought two cats from a breeder):</p>
				<ol>
					<li> Why did he go back to the same breeder? 
						<ul><li>Able to build a relationship with the breeder</li>
							<ul>
							<li>Built trust</li></ul>
							<li>Smooth process</li>
						</ul>

						
					</li>
					<li> What was he looking for when using an app? <ul><li>An option to also exclude pets he has already looked at </li></ul>

						
					</li>
					
				</ol>
				<p class="caseText interviewHeading">Interview Two (adopted two guinea pigs from a shelter):</p>
				<ol>
					<li> Why did she choose to not apply through an adoption app?
						<ul><li>Felt discouraged that she was not getting any responses or that the animals she applied for were already adopted</li>
						</ul>

						
					</li>
					<li> What was she looking for? <ul><li>A last updated option</li></ul>

						
					</li>
					
				</ol>
				<p class="caseText interviewHeading">Interview Three (bought dog from a breeder and adopted cat from a shelter) </p>
				<ol>
					<li> Why didnâ€™t he adopt through Petfinder?
						<ul><li>Each shelter has a different application but the basics stay the same</li>
							<ul>
							<li>Took too much time rewriting the same info</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>

						
					</li>
					<li> What was he looking for? 
						<ul><li>Easier application process</li>
							<ul>
							<li>Universal application?</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>

						
					</li>
					
				</ol>

			<p class="caseHeading">Starting Out</p>
			<p class="caseText">I started taking some inspiration from other pet adoption apps to make sure I understand key screens and user flow. I looked at food delivery apps such as Grubhub and Uber Eats to understand how they make it easy and simple to press deliver and decide what you want. One of my initial ideas was to incorporate a Tinder inspired swipe interaction to make the experience of finding your pet engaging and entertaining. I looked at some other dating apps to see how they go about two people finding each other. </p>
	</div>



	<div class="pawpalCase">
		<p class="caseText">I began to sketch some iterations of different screens to get a better idea of how I want the app to look like.</p>

	<div class="pawpalCase">

			<p class="caseText">Then I used Figma to create low-fidelity wireframes with interactivity. The home screen would be an event and article page where users can see adoption events nearby and receive informative articles. The swipe screen would show animals of your choice that you could swipe right to favorite, or if you have fallen in love with them there would also be an option to send a message to the shelter to inquire about them if matched.The account screen would also include an area to view your favorited animals, recents, and animals from shelters you have favorited. I tested the prototype with user flow with peers in my class and got great feedback. From this feedback, I saw how I started to lose the main focus of the app within the home screen. I realized that main focus should be showing the user animals for them to interact with and events can be a secondary thing to also aid them on their search.</p>

			<p class="caseHeading">Current Progress</p>
			<p class="caseText">This is a work in progress! Currently, I am adding design elements and iterating through many screens. The deadline of this project is in one week and hopefully I will be able to implement many of the ideas I had to make this app feel whole.</p>
